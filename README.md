Foodify not only creates a portal that bridges the gap between people who want to sell left over food and people who want to buy it, but it also gives recipes that can be created out of leftover food. :pizza:
</p>
<p>
Foodify is made keeping the user in mind. It has an innovative, dynamic and easy to navigate user interface that automatically recognises dishes based on a simple image. Via this image, it scrapes the internet for recipes or can put the dish up for sale for people who are willing to buy it. :hamburger:

### Directions for Testing :hammer_and_pick:
Contact the app owners becuase the app is being hosted on a private server created by the developers themselves.

In case, you clone the app, it won't give you any functionality as you won't have access to the server.

### Features


* Click 2 Cook - Generate Recipes from your let over foods via a single image.
* Click 2 Share - Share your food with others who might like to have it or buy it from someone
